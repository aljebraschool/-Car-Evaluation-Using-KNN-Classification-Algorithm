# -Car-Evaluation-Using-KNN-Classification-Algorithm
This project implements one of the basic classifications Algorithms called the K-Nearest Neighbour algorithm. 
This project got it data set from UCI which is machine learning repository.
The model will be able to classify cars as Unaccurate, accurate, good or very good based on six features of the cars.
The project was implemented using Jupyter notebook
